            <head>President Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg</head>
            <p>The consecration of the Soldiers' Cemetery at Gettysburg, Pa., took place on the 10th of Nobermber.
               It was a day that will long live in the memory of those who winessed the inspiring demon-errssious
               <!-- this "d" word can't be read --> of the occasion.The Oration of Edward Everett was, as all his 
               orations are, exceedingly appropritate and elegant. It required two hours for ist delivery, but no 
               intelligent hearer is over ****<!-- this word can't be read, I would take a guess as "Impatient" --> 
               for MR.Everett to close; as there were 30,000 and 50,000 present, it is hardly to be expected that 
               all were hearers, however. He usually speaks without notes, *eelling<!-- this word can't be read --> 
               from memory the longest addre**<!-- this word can't be read -->, yet with such perfect free-dom of 
               manner that the closest observer would never ****<!-- this word can't be read --> that his sentences 
               were not born of the moment and entirely extemporaneous.
               After the oration and a dirge by a choir from the M**** Association<!-- this word can't be read --> 
               of Baltimore, President Lincoin **<!-- this word can't be read, big ink circle --> introduced.
               We have room to-day for little farther notice of the conseration exercises than to copy entire the
               President's speech. Of course it was short,pithy and pra*****.
               <!-- those 2 words can't be read, so I need to take a guess -->
               He said:</p>
            <p>Four scores and seven years ago our fathers established upon
               this continent a government subscribed in liberty and dedicated 
               to the fundamental principles that all men are created equal by 
               a good God. [Applause] <!-- quit different form the offical version --> .
               Now we are engaged in a great conte*!<!-- this word can't be read -->---
               the question whether<!-- those 2 words can't be read -->this nation, any nation, so
               conse-*** **<!-- this word can't be read -->, so e****, can long remain. We are met on a
               great ******<!-- this word can't be read --> of the war; we are met here to dedi-cate a 
               portion of that field as the *** resting place of those hwo have given their *** that the
               *** ***** might live. It is all right, *** and proper, that we  should do this- but in a
               larger sense, we cannot dedicate- we cannot consecrated- we cannot hallow this ground.
               The brave and self-sacrificing men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
               it far above our power to add or to de-tract[Great applause] It is for us, rather-the living
               -be *** and here to the unfin-ished work that they have thus far so nobly carried forward.
               ["Good" and great applause.] It is better for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining 
               be-fore us: for ****<!-- this word can't be read --> our d devotion to that cause for which 
               they gave the full measure<!-- this word can't be read --> of their devotion. Here let us 
               resolve that what they have done shall not have b***<!-- this word can't be read --> done
               in vain; that the nation shall, under Gove, have a new birth; that the Government of the
               people; founded by the people, shall not perish.</p>
